# WhaBot AI Companion

**Interact seamlessly with OpenAI through WhatsApp, enabling prompt-based conversations with AI models.**

WhaBot AI Companion is a serverless solution designed to integrate OpenAI API (v4) with WhatsApp messaging. This project enables users to send queries through WhatsApp, processes them via OpenAI's API, and responds with the AI-generated output—all without manual intervention. The solution is hosted on AWS Lambda with API Gateway, leveraging Node.js modules packaged into a layer for efficient and scalable execution.

## Features

- **WhatsApp Integration**: Receive user queries via WhatsApp messaging.
- **OpenAI API Integration**: Utilize OpenAI API (v4) for natural language processing and generate AI-powered responses.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Hosted on AWS Lambda with API Gateway for seamless and scalable operations.
- **Node.js Modules as Layers**: Dependencies are packaged into layers for easier management and deployment.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Utilizes Serverless YAML for defining and managing the infrastructure.

## Getting Started

To set up and deploy the WhaBot AI Companion, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have an AWS account set up with appropriate permissions and access to the OpenAI API.
2. **Configuration**:
   - Update the necessary configurations such as API keys, WhatsApp number, and any specific settings in the designated configuration files.
3. **Deployment**:
   - Use Serverless YAML to define the AWS infrastructure and deploy the solution.
4. **Testing**:
   - Send messages to the configured WhatsApp number and observe the responses generated by the AI.
